            D++devices are external devices used as intimal servers
            providing local assistance to our daily used devices by
            dedicating each D++device to one specific task/process, and
            then combining them, to solve some fundamental
            vulnerabilities, such as the <a
              href="https://meltdownattack.com/">meltdown and spectre</a>
            proven to remove the independence of processes in a singular
